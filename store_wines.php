              <h3>STORE WINES PROPERLY</h3>
              <div class="mb-4 fw-bold mt-4">Store wines properly</div>
              <p class="mb-0">Even if we primarily choose wines that are suitable for immediate enjoyment, there are also wines that still need time to mature. However, these wines should not necessarily wait in a wine rack in the living room to be used. We have put together all the information for you that will make it easier to store fine wines correctly.</p>
              <div class="mb-4 fw-bold">The good old wine cellar</div>
              <p>Classically, a wine - both with winegrowers and privately - matures in the cellar. Of course, old vaulted cellars are particularly stylish. The most important prerequisites for storing maturing wine are uniform coolness, darkness and quiet. In addition, there should also be a certain level of humidity. In any case, constant temperature fluctuations should be avoided. Because: Higher storage temperatures mean that the wine loses freshness more quickly. In addition, the maturation and aging process of the wine takes place faster than in a cool storage location. If the wine is stored warmer or too warm, it loses quality and cannot develop its full potential.</p>
              <p>An even temperature of approx. 10°C to 16°C is optimal for wine. Even if the corks are now well protected from drying out by a non-porous capsule, which has significantly reduced the importance of humidity in wine storage, a well-ventilated cellar with a humidity of 70% to 90% is still recommended for long-term storage % is the ideal solution. Higher humidity levels will not damage the wine, but bottle labels can suffer from the humidity and become illegible, losing information about the stored wine.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">If wine is stored in a light color - i.e. under the influence of light - this leads to premature signs of aging, which are undesirable. In this case, the wine is best kept in cartons or crates. It is important to ensure that the wine is stored horizontally so that the cork is wetted by the liquid and remains moist. In this way, the mouth of the bottle remains securely closed and air cannot enter.</p>
              <div class="mb-4 fw-bold mt-3">Wine cellar in your own home</div>
              <p>If you want to implement a suitable wine storage solution on your own, you will find various wine racks on the market that are designed as grid systems and can therefore be accommodated in a very space-saving manner and used flexibly. Custom-fit shelves are available for every nook and cranny. Ideally, a niche or a place under the basement stairs should be chosen for the attachment or installation of the shelves, with an outer wall adjoining them if possible.</p>
              <p>If a new building is planned, a suitable cellar room for wine storage should be provided right away. The necessary shelves for the wine bottles can also be bricked up directly. Brick wine racks offer the advantage that the stones are cool and can help the wine to a relatively constant temperature.</p>
              <div class="mb-4 fw-bold">Store wine in the apartment</div>
              <p>Maturing wines that have to be stored for a longer period of time are best kept in a wine climate cabinet in the apartment. Such cabinets are available in different sizes. They ensure a constant temperature and are also often very attractively designed, so that they definitely deserve an openly visible location in the apartment.</p>
              <div class="mb-4 fw-bold">How long can wine be stored?</div>
              <p>Normal, simple everyday wines that impress with their freshness can usually be stored in the refrigerator or cellar for a few days or weeks without any problems - even if the storage conditions are not ideal.</p>
              <p>With wines from higher price categories - especially with wines of higher quality levels, you have to think a lot more about storage in order not to endanger the money invested and the wine quality.</p>
              <div class="mb-4 fw-bold">How long does a wine keep?</div>
              <p>In the case of wine, the shelf life depends on the residual sugar it contains, the fruit acid it contains and the alcohol it contains. Wines that have a high sugar content have a very long lifespan. These sweet wines include, for example, ice wines, Beerenauslese or Trockenbeerenauslese.</p>
              <p>The higher the acidity of a wine, the more suitable the wine is for longer storage. Experience has shown that wines with an acidity of 7 per mille or more are characterized by their robustness and longevity.</p>
              <p>With its bactericidal and preserving properties, the alcohol makes an important contribution to the shelf life of the wine. For this reason, wines that have at least 10% alcohol by volume – ideally 12% by volume – are to be preferred for a longer storage period.</p>

              <ul class="p-0" style="color: var(--text-color);">
                <li>The size of the bottles also plays a role in wine storage. Wines mature faster in small bottles and also lose substance faster. The aging process is slower in magnum bottles.</li>
                <li>Paint fixative or hairspray can be used to protect labels from moisture.</li>
                <li>When aging for a very long time - for decades, it makes sense to have a winemaker on hand to help with the re-corking of the bottles, which is required about every 15 to 20 years.</li>
