                <li>They take the time for the searching client and clarify all the important facts in a personal conversation before the documents are sent.</li>
                <li>If your portfolio allows, you offer alternative properties without being asked if the requested property does not meet the customer's expectations.</li>
                <li>Friendliness and competence as well as professional, transparent communication are an expression of all employees in your law firm.</li>

              </ol>
              <p><strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT regularly checks how well the brokers comply with these quality guidelines . However, the most important role is played by the user himself – that is, you!</p>
              <h5>YOUR RATING GIVES YOU A SEAL:</h5>
              <h5>THE <strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT QUALITY PROGRAM</h5>
              <img class="my-4" src="./assets/img/fmh-siege.png" alt="">
              <p>In 2011 we introduced a rating system that is unique in the industry. As the only quality program in Austria's real estate industry, we let our users have their say. With just a few clicks, you too can give your honest opinion on the broker's services.</p>
              <h5>HOW TO AWARD SEALS:</h5>
              <p>A few days after you have inquired about a property, you will receive an e-mail with the opportunity to rate the agent.</p>
              <ul class="ps-3 mb-3">
                <li>The evaluation is based on criteria such as e.g.:</li>
                <li>Does the online representation match the real property?</li>
                <li>Did the agent respond promptly to your request?</li>
                <li>Did the broker help you with detailed knowledge?</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Your feedback will be evaluated by us personally. Agents who have given us a relevant amount of user feedback and whose evaluation shows more than two-thirds of customer satisfaction are then awarded the quality agent seal by us once a year. This is not only very important to ensure a high quality of the offers for you, the event surrounding the award is also a lot of fun for us.</p>
              <p><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">Link to the last quality broker gala</a></p>
              <h5>REVIEWS THAT CREATE TRUST:</h5>
              <h5><strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT SHOWS YOU WHO THE BEST PROVIDERS ARE</h5>
              <p>Positive feedback is the best motivation for real estate providers. Especially when everyone can see them. That's why we show you directly for each property whether a provider is one of the quality brokers and has agreed to the <strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT netiquette. In order to further emphasize the broker's strengths and to show you what you can particularly look forward to, positive ratings in terms of recommendation, friendliness and response time are also marked with symbols.</p>
              <img src="./assets/img/symbole.png" alt="">
              <p>We are proud to be able to say that we at <strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT are the first of all real estate portals in Austria to make such an award in order to support you in your search with more transparency and user-friendliness.</p>
              <h5>THE MOST IMPORTANT SUMMARY</h5>
              <p>So the quality program brings something to everyone.</p>
              <p><strong>Your opinion</strong> , your praise and your criticism have an impact and help other searchers to find the best providers. <strong>The brokers</strong> can improve their service based on your feedback. <strong>We are happy</strong> because in the end it is the property seeker who benefits from this process – that is, you.</p>
              <p>Important: quality brokers are the best of the best, but the other brokers on <strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT also do an excellent job.</p>
              <p>Some providers cannot (yet) qualify for the seal of quality or an outstanding rating - because they have only recently offered properties on <strong>FIND</strong> MY <strong>HOME</strong> .AT or have received too few ratings from searchers. (Of course, the same applies to a different degree for the icons "Friendliness", "Reaction" & "Recommendation".)</p>
              <p>But that doesn't mean they don't work very well. Maybe they can look forward to being recognized as a quality agent next time.</p>
              <p><a href="quality_broker.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">Here is an overview of the quality brokers who have received awards so far.</a></p>
              <p>What do you say?</p>
              <p>We look forward to your feedback at <a href="#" target="_blank" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">feedback@findmyhome.at</a> !</p>
