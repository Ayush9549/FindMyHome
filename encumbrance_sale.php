              <h3>DEFINITION: USUFRUCT IN AUSTRIA</h3>
              <p>The usufruct allows the beneficiary to live in someone else's <a href="condominiums_list.php" class="text-decoration-underline a_color">home</a> , but goes even further than <a href="#" class="text-decoration-underline a_color">a right of residence or right of use</a> . Specifically, the owner allows another person to use the property without restrictions (while preserving the substance). This means that it can be used personally, but it can also be rented out.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4"> Is a usufruct entered in the <a href="land_register.php" class="text-decoration-underline a_color">land register</a> ?</h6>
              
              <p>A usufruct does not have to be entered in the land register, but this gives it real effect, i.e. it can be enforced against any (future) owner. So if you want to be absolutely sure that the usufruct right is retained even if <a href="#" class="text-decoration-underline a_color">the property is sold , you should enter it in the land register.</a></p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4"> What is the difference between right of residence and right of usufruct?</h6>
              
              <p class="mb-0">The main difference lies in the rentability, which is not permitted under normal housing law.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">Both are very far-reaching rights that cannot be revoked. In other words: a person with a right of residence or a right of usufruct cannot be evicted from the <a href="#" class="text-decoration-underline a_color">property</a></p>
              <p>, or only in the event of serious offences . She retains these rights until her death.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4"> What are the disadvantages of usufruct?</h6>
              
              <p>The usufruct is a far-reaching right - and that can of course also become a problem over time: for example, if there is a personal quarrel between the owner and the person with the usufruct, the latter's right can hardly be taken away. This means that you should think very carefully about the granting of usufruct rights. The difficulties even go so far that the property in question can only be sold with great difficulty, because even if the owner changes, the usufruct continues to exist. Of course, this severely limits the number of interested buyers.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4"> What is the encumbrance and sale ban?</h6>
              
              <p>With the ban on encumbrance and sale, the owner can neither encumber a property (e.g. with a loan or usufruct) nor sell or give it away without the consent of the beneficiary. The prohibition may, but need not, include both restrictions.</p>
              <p>The ban only becomes effective against any outsider once it has been entered in the land register. However, the prohibition of sale and encumbrance can only be entered in the land register if it is granted between spouses or between (grand)parents and (stepchildren, in-laws or grandchildren).</p>
