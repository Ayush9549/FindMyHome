                <h4>FAREWELL WITHOUT TEARS – TIPS FOR RETURNING YOUR HOME</h4>
                <h5>Farewell Without Tears</h5>
                <p class="mt-2">The return of the old apartment is the final chapter in moving to a new place. This does not always go smoothly - their condition is always a subject of dispute.</p>
                <p class="">The moving boxes are piled up in the new apartment, the old one is already empty. All that remains is to return them to the landlord or his property manager, who in return will transfer the deposit to the outgoing tenant's account. But occasionally this step does not go smoothly. "Basically, a tenant must return the apartment in the same condition as he took it over - minus all traces of normal wear and tear. However, it happens again and again that landlords present normal wear and tear as damage. Then the tenants get no or much less deposit refunded," says Walter Rosifka, housing law expert at the Chamber of Labour.</p>
                <h6>Tired Topic Boreholes</h6>
                <p class="">For example, drill holes for attaching kitchen cabinets, curtain rails, shelves, pictures or towel rails in the bathroom are often discussed. "If these devices are duly removed when pulling out, the drill holes left behind are normal wear and tear," says Rosifka. The same applies to scratches in the parquet. "Signs of use are not damage," specifies the housing law expert. Things are different if, for example, the carpet has burn holes - this damage can very well be compensated for by the departing tenant.</p>
                <h6>Coloring is Not Compulsory</h6>
                <p class="">A common point of contention is the painting of the rooms. "An obligation to paint is only legally effective if it has been explicitly agreed in an individually negotiated contract between tenant and landlord," explains the housing law expert. The outgoing tenant must paint again before moving out if the wall paint has been excessively worn or if the walls have been painted with colors that are unusual for the location, such as red or black.</p>
                <h6>Handover Protocol</h6>
                <p class="">In any case, Rosifka advises that when the apartment is returned, a handover protocol and photos of the apartment should be made in the presence of witnesses. The minutes should include the names of the transferor and transferee as well as the duration of the tenancy. On the other hand, it should contain a precise description of the apartment and the associated basement room - including an inventory list and description of the condition of floors, walls, doors, windows, sanitary facilities and, if necessary, furniture, meter readings and number of keys. "If you don't agree with the protocol, you shouldn't sign it," says Rosifka. In this context, he recommends creating such documentation at the time of the takeover, in order to be able to better document the changes over the course of the tenancy.</p>
                <h6>Claim for Compensation</h6>
                <p class="">If there is damage, the outgoing tenant must compensate the landlord for this. However, he can only charge the current value for this, not the new price or deduct it from the deposit. If necessary, the outgoing tenant can also demand money from the landlord. And that is if he has significantly improved the condition of the apartment during the rental period. “However, this only applies if these investments are replaceable, still effective and useful and not yet completely depreciated. And he must assert the claim for compensation in good time and in writing,” says Rosikfa. Among other things, the construction or redesign of water, light and gas lines, heating or sanitary facilities are considered to be eligible for replacement, the merging of two substandard apartments and the category increase that took place in the course of the same or the installation of insulating and/or soundproof windows as well as heat insulation measures. The tenant will not be reimbursed for the expenses for wall construction or a fitted kitchen - even if they remain in the apartment.</p>
