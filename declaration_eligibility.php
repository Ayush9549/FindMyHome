              <p>With the declaration of attachment in a purchase contract, the person entitled to the property (seller's side) makes a declaration that he consents to the <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">incorporation</a> of another person (buyer's side) and thus agrees to the entry of the buyer in the <a href="land_register.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">land register .</a> The declaration of eligibility is a prerequisite for incorporation in the land register.</p>

              <h6 class="mb-4">Is a declaration of levy on the part of the seller a prerequisite for the buyer to be able to purchase a property?</h6>
              
              <p>The postponement clause in the contract is not a prerequisite for the purchase of the property by the buyer. The minimum content requirements that must be specified in the case of a property purchase and about which there must be agreement between the parties are the property being purchased and the purchase price.</p>
              <p>In principle, further agreements are not a prerequisite for the effectiveness of a purchase contract.</p>
              <p>However, a valid purchase contract alone is not sufficient for the incorporation of the buyer's property right. The prerequisite for this is a deed that can be entered in the accounts according to the provisions of the Land Register Act. The seller must expressly consent to the transfer of his title to the buyer. Otherwise, the consent can also be enforced by the buyer through legal action.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4">Does every seller have to sign a waiver?</h6>
              
              <p>Yes. If there is a majority of people on the seller's side, all sellers must also sign the declaration of eligibility.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4">What does a declaration of assignment look like in terms of content?</h6>
              
              <p>From the point of view of content, the declaration of assignment is limited to the fact that the seller gives his consent, according to which the right of ownership for the buyer for the property to be purchased (exact description) can be incorporated on the basis of the relevant contract.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4">Is there a template for the declaration of suspension or does it come from a lawyer?</h6>
              
              <p>The declaration of posting is usually included in the purchase contract and therefore usually comes from the person who set up the contract.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4">What do sellers, but also buyers, have to pay attention to in a declaration of deferral?</h6>
              
              <p>The contracting parties must ensure that the absence of the declaration of posting means a formal defect. In this case, the relevant land register application is based on a document that may be effective under civil law regulations, but cannot be incorporated.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that in the case of a separately issued declaration of suspension, the corresponding document must also meet the requirements of a document that can be incorporated (court or <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">notarized</a> signature).</p>
