              <h3>DEFINITION OF REAL ESTATE TRANSFER TAX. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PAID AND FREE TRANSFERS.</h3>
              <p>The real estate transfer tax taxes the paid and unpaid transactions in Austrian real estate. Tax debtors are (at least theoretically) both the transferor and the transferee. In many cases, however, the regulation is made in such a way that the transferee - i.e. the buyer or recipient - bears the real estate transfer tax.</p>
              <p>The assessment basis for the tax is basically the value of the consideration (e.g. the purchase price), but at least the value of the <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">property</a> (especially in the case of gifts in the family association). In exceptional cases, for example when acquiring agricultural land, the simple <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">assessed value</a> is decisive.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4 mt-4">Who has to pay real estate transfer tax?</h6>
              
              <p>In principle, as I said, both parties involved in the sale, exchange or donation of a property.</p>
              <p>It is crucial that the contracting parties agree on the real estate transaction, including the subject of the transaction and the purchase price. What sounds complicated is actually quite simple: if the transferor and the transferee sign the contract for the purchase or sale of <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">real estate , for example, the transaction takes place and then the real estate transfer tax has to be paid.</a> Incidentally, it is the largest cost item among the <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">"additional costs of buying an apartment" or "additional costs of buying a house"</a> .</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4 mt-4">How much is the real estate transfer tax?</h6>
              
              <p>The real estate transfer tax is generally 3.5% of the consideration (e.g. the purchase price) in the case of a paid transfer (definition of “paid”, “free of charge” and “partially paid” see below).</p>
              <p>Since the <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">2016 tax reform,</a> the real estate transfer tax has been charged according to a graduated tariff for free and partially paid transfers. Accordingly, the tax is based on the property value, for the first 250,000 euros 0.5% tax is charged, for the next 150,000 euros 2% and beyond that 3.5% of the property value.
              Here is an official <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">calculator for calculating the property value</a> from the Federal Ministry of Finance.</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4 mt-4">What is the difference between real estate transfer tax and real estate income tax?</h6>
              
              <p class="mb-0">The real estate transfer tax differs in several aspects from the <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">real estate income tax</a> :</p>
              <p class="mb-0">- It is paid for the entire value, e.g. the entire purchase price</p>
              <p class="mb-0">- The real estate income tax, on the other hand, is only paid for the profit (= difference between the purchase price and the sales price)</p>
              <p class="mb-0">- The real estate transfer tax is basically paid by both parties involved to be paid, buyer as well as seller, giver as well as recipient</p>
              <p class="mb-0">- only the seller has to pay the real estate income tax, since he is the one who makes a profit</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4 mt-4">What changed in the <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline">real estate transfer tax at the beginning of 2016</a> ?</h6>
              
              <p>The assessment basis for a gratuitous transfer (see definition below) has changed. (In the case of a paid purchase, the consideration, i.e. the amount paid, continues to serve as the basis for assessment). In the case of gratuitous transactions, three times the assessed value used to be used as the basis for assessing the real estate transfer tax; since the beginning of 2016, the higher real estate value has been used for this purpose.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, this is also used if the amount paid is less than this property value (i.e. with a very good “friend price”). In this case one speaks of a part-time purchase (see below).</p>
              
              <h6 class="mb-4 mt-4">What is free and what is partial payment?</h6>
              
              <p>First of all, perhaps the transfer against payment should be explained: This is the case when the property is sold for more than 70% of the property value.</p>
              <p>If the value of the consideration (e.g. purchase price) amounts to a maximum of 30% of the property value, it is <strong>free of charge</strong> .</p>
              <p>In between, i.e. if the value of the consideration is more than 30% but less than 70% of the property value, there is a <strong>partial purchase</strong> .</p>
              <p>Certain acquisitions are always deemed to be free of charge, eg acquisitions after death through inheritance, legacy or legacies, as well as acquisitions within the family group among living persons.</p>
