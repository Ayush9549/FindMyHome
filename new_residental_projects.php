            <h6>Privately financed residential projects with many commission-free apartments</h6>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Here you will find new construction projects that are currently being developed or have already been completed with free financing - the apartments come directly from the developer and are therefore brand new for first occupancy and in many cases commission-free. Privately financed means that these housing projects are created without public subsidies and are developed and implemented by independent property development companies.</p>
            <p class="">Privately financed apartments are usually commission-free condominiums, but also rental apartments. They are always part of a holistic residential project, i.e. an entire building or a complete complex. There are privately financed housing projects all over Austria, from Vienna to Lower Austria to Vorarlberg.</p>
            <p class="">The advantage of these new construction projects: They are real estate built according to the highest, contemporary standards, which impress both architecturally and with the high quality of life. As a future resident, you can enjoy the convenience of moving in for the first time â€“ nobody has lived in the apartment before you. Sometimes property developers (especially in Vienna) revitalize old buildings for privately financed housing projects - due to the total renovation, however, one must speak of new apartments in this case according to the highest modern standards, since, for example, all the equipment and technology are state-of-the-art. These are condominiums and rental apartments at the highest level. On the other hand, if you are looking for an affordable rental apartment, you are in good hands with the subsidized housing projects.</p>
            <p class="my-4">If you click on the respective residential complex, you will be forwarded directly to an information page for the developer in question - there you will find all data such as dimensions and design of the available individual properties, precise details on location and price as well as contact details for the developer responsible.</p>
