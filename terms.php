                <p class="mb-0">This means that the owner can neither encumber the property (e.g. with a loan or usufruct) nor sell it or give it away without the consent of the beneficiary. The prohibition may, but need not, include both restrictions.</p>
                <p>The ban only becomes effective against any outsider once it has been entered in the land register. However, the ban on sale and encumbrance can only be entered in the land register if it is granted between spouses or between (grand)parents and (stepchildren, in-laws or grandchildren) children.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="operating_cost.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Operating costs</a></h6>

                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="appraised.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Appraised</a></h6>
                <p>value Appraised value describes the value of a piece of land and the buildings on it. It is determined by the tax office. <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Until the 2015/2016 tax reform,</a> the assessed value servedas the basis for calculating <a href="real_estate_tax.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">the real estate transfer tax</a> . With a few exceptions, the real estate transfer tax is nowcalculated <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">from the real estate value , which is based on the market value</a> – which is significantly higher than the assessed value.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Right of Submission</a></h6>
                <p>Where the MRG is applicable to a lease, the main tenant can assign their right to rent to certain close relatives who have urgent housing needs. The prerequisite is that you have lived with him in the apartment for at least two years</p>
                <p>This rule applies to all relatives in the straight line (i.e. children, grandchildren and parents), spouses and adopted children. Siblings also have a right of entry, but they must have lived in the same household for five years.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Incorporation</a></h6>
                <p>Incorporation (also intabulation) refers to a certain form of entry in the land register. The entry in the <a href="land_register.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">land register</a> causes either an unconditional acquisition of rights or, in the event of deletion, a loss of rights and is a prerequisite for the acquisition of real rights to real estate.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Energy performance certificate / energy efficiency / energy index</a></h6>
                <p>When renting, leasing and <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">selling real estate,</a> an energy performance certificate must be presented. It contains essential information on the thermal quality and energy consumption of a building.</p>
                <p>The energy index f indicates the specific heating requirement. It tells you how much energy a house needs per square meter per year for space heating. The energy index is printed next to the colored scale in the corresponding category.</p>
                <p>The "overall energy efficiency factor" (fGEE) compares the building with a reference object from the building stock from 2007. It can thus be estimated whether the existing property is better (fGEE < 1) or worse (fGEE > 1) in terms of energy.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Euribor</a></h6>
                <p>Euribor is the average interest rate at which a selection of European banks grant each other EURO bonds with different maturities. It serves as a basis for calculating interest on various investment products, such as savings accounts or loans for real estate financing.</p>

                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Usufruct Right</a></h6>
                <p>With a usufruct right, the owner allows another person to use his property without restrictions while preserving the substance. The utility can be either personal use or rental. A usufruct does not have to be entered in the land register, but this gives it effect in rem, i.e. it can be enforced against any (future) owner.</p>
              </div>
              <!--===================== Terms with G =====================-->

                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Right of use / right of residence</a></h6>
                <p>The right of residence is a personal easement and allows the beneficiary to live in someone else's home. It can be structuredas a right of use or as<a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank"> a usufruct right .</a></p>
                <p class="mb-0">If the right of residence refers to all habitable parts of the house and the person entitled to live in the building may use the building without restriction (e.g. also rent it out), there is a right of usufruct.</p>
                <p>The interpretation of the contract is decisive.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="land_register.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Land register</a></h6>
                <p class="mb-0">The land register is a public directory in which, for example, ownership of a property (including real estate), but also residential property, lien or building rights are recorded.</p>
                <p>It is maintained by the district courts and is open to the public.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="real_estate_tax.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Real estate transfer tax</a></h6>
                <p>The real estate transfer tax levies taxes on the free and non-remunerated movement of domestic real estate. Tax debtors are (at least theoretically) both the transferor and the transferee.</p>
                <p>The assessment basis is basically the value of the consideration (e.g. the purchase price), but at least the value of the property (especially in the case of gifts in the family association). In exceptional cases, for example when acquiring agricultural land, the simple <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">assessed value</a> is decisive.</p>
                <p>The partial scope of application of the MRG includes rental properties that are rented without public funds due to a rental after June 30th. building permit issued in 1953. With regard to the MRG, only the provisions on grandfathering and tenancy law in the event of death apply to these, but in particular not the regulation on rent.</p>

              <div class="h_container mt-4">
                <div class="title w-100 ps-3 py-2 text-dark mb-3">Terms with H</div>
                <a href="#back_to_overview#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline mb-3 d-block">Back to overview</a>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Main rent / sublease</a></h6>
                <p class="mb-0">Main rent exists when the rental contractis concluded <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">with the owner (or usufructuary ) of a property, with the tenant (or lessee) of an apartment building or with the apartment owner. </a>If a rental contract is not concluded with the owner but with the tenant of the apartment, there is a sublease.</p>
                <p>More about this here:<a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank"> Subletting: Subletting despite a ban in the rental agreement?</a></p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Household insurance / liability insurance</a></h6>
                <p>Every resident of a property should have household insurance. It pays for the repair or replacement of damaged items in a household. Whether household insurance pays for the repair of damage depends on whether the cause of the damage is recorded in the policy. You should therefore pay attention to the causes (e.g. storm, burglary, fire, etc.) you are insured against. The more comprehensive the insurance, the more expensive it is of course.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Mortgage</a></h6>
                <p>A mortgage is a lien on an immovable property such as real estate. The right of lien is a right in rem to secure a claim (security function).</p>
                <p>Usually, the credit institution that finances a real estate purchase with the right of lien has the right to access a certain thing belonging to the debtor (e.g. the property) to collect this secured claim (satisfaction function) - if the debtor, for example, makes his repayments within a certain period can no longer afford.</p>
              </div>
              <!--===================== Terms with I =====================-->
              <div class="i_container mt-4">
                <div class="title w-100 ps-3 py-2 text-dark mb-3">Terms with I</div>

                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Ideal co-ownership</a></h6>
                <p>An item is co-ownership if several people are entitled to the right of ownership. Each co-owner is only entitled to a certain quota (ideal share). In the case of real estate, the term “simple co-ownership” is also common.</p>
                <p>In principle, a co-owner can dispose of his own share alone, but only all co-owners can dispose of the entire thing together. This means that a co-owner can sell his share without the consent of the other co-owners</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="real_estate_tax.php" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Real estate income tax</a></h6>
                <p>The real estate income tax taxes the profit from the private sale of real estate, which is why only purchase and sale transactions against payment are recorded. The real estate income tax is to be borne by the seller.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Real estate is not just land, but also buildings (including <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">condominiums</a> ) and rights equivalent to real estate, such as building rights.</p>
                <p>The tax is 30% of the profit made.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Inflation deduction</a></h6>
                <p>The inflation deduction has been omitted since 2016. Until then, the assessment basis for real estate income tax for new properties was reduced by the inflation deduction of 2% from the 11th year.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Maintenance & Repair</a></h6>
                <p>The distinction between maintenance and repair of real estate is essentially of interest for the depreciation of expenses, since different regulations apply to these two aspects.</p>
                <h6 class="mb-4"><a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">Intabulation</a></h6>
                <p>Intabulation (also incorporation) is a specific form of entry in the land register.

                <p>In order to understand cold progression, the system of progressive wage and income tax must be understood: income is split – based on legal limits – and each part is charged a different tax rate. The first part is tax-free, the following parts are subject to an ever increasing tax rate.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Every year the salary is adjusted for inflation (depreciation of money), i.e. it increases nominally (but not in terms of value). If the salary increases due to the inflation adjustment so that you get to the next tariff level, you pay more taxes without actually earning more. This phenomenon is called cold progression.</p>
                <p>In order to avoid the cold progression, the tariff levels must be adjusted annually for inflation.</p>

              <p>The tenant protection anchored in the MRG (Rental Law) has a predominantly mandatory character, so it cannot be contractually changed to the detriment of the tenant. However, only those who fall within the scope enjoy protection.</p>
              <p>Objects in old buildings and subsidized new buildings fall within the full scope of application, and their tenants enjoy comprehensive protection.</p>
              <p>The partial scope of application of the MRG includes rental properties that are rented without public funds due to a rental after June 30th. building permit issued in 1953. With regard to the MRG, only the provisions on grandfathering and tenancy law in the event of death apply to these, but in particular not the regulation on rent.</p>
              <p>The full exemptions from the MRG include rental contracts that are concluded in the context of accommodation or garages, as well as homes, official apartments, second homes or holiday apartments and, since January 1, 2002, rental contracts for one- and two-family houses.</p>

              <p>The term “parification” refers to the justification of home ownership . This justification of home ownership can only be done for the entire property. This means that there is no coexistence of home ownership and simple co-ownership (a so-called “mixed house”).</p>

              <p>In the case of developed land, the real division takes place through the establishment of <a href="#" class="a_color text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">residential property</a> or through the division of the land area.

              <p>In the full application area of the MRG (Tenancy Law), the free agreement of the rent is not permitted. Rather, both the amount of the maximum permissible main rent and what operating costs can be offset are regulated by this law.</p>
              <p>According to the MRG, the maximum rent that can be demanded as the main rent for an apartment is the so-called benchmark rent. The procedure for calculating the benchmark rent is relatively complicated. Based on a reference value, which is to be announced for each federal state by ordinance from the Federal Ministry of Justice, depending on the size of the apartment, equipment, condition and location of the specific apartment, the reference value rent for this apartment is calculated with surcharges and deductions.</p>
              <p>For example, there are deductions for floors without a lift, no basement compartment, above-average noise, poor lighting, on the other hand, for example, surcharges for green areas, quiet areas, existing balconies or terraces, intercoms, washing machine connections, telecable connections.</p>
