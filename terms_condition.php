            <h5>CONDITIONS</h5>
            <h6>1. Subject of the contract and scope</h6>
            <p>1.1. FindMyHome.at GmbH operates a platform at www.findmyhome.at on which commercial providers can advertise real estate. FindMyHome.at also makes the website available for advertising.</p>
            <p>1.2. As an advertiser of real estate or advertising and generally as a user of our site, you expressly recognize the validity of these General Terms and Conditions (GTC). </p>
            <p>1.3. These terms and conditions apply to all projects on the FindMyHome.at platform, regardless of which Internet address or link the user of our service came across FindMyHome.at. </p>
            <h6>2. Rights and obligations of the contractual partners</h6>
            <p>2.1. Commercial advertisers expressly undertake to disclose their commercial status by entering the advertisement under "Commercial advertisement".
            </p>
            <p>2.2. The advertisements must not violate applicable Austrian law either in terms of content, wording or the purpose pursued. As part of the use of our service, it is expressly forbidden to enter or send content by e-mail that infringes patent rights, copyrights, property rights, trademark rights or other rights of third parties. The advertiser undertakes to indemnify and hold harmless FindMyHome.at with regard to all disadvantages that arise for FindMyHome.at as a result of an illegal advertisement.
            </p>
            <p>2.3. FindMyHome.at is entitled to attach your company name and your brand, with a link to the homepage, to the products produced by iIhr even without special permission from the client.</p>

            <p>3.1. In the case of commercial advertisers, the contract is concluded for the minimum term specified in the order form. A premature termination of the contract by the advertiser is not possible. After this term has expired, the contract is automatically extended by twelve months at a time, unless the advertiser terminates the contract by giving one month's notice.</p>
            <p>3.2. Payment must be made upon receipt of the invoice without deduction of a discount. If the commercial advertiser is more than 14 days in arrears with an installment, the deadline is lost and the entire amount still outstanding for the minimum contract period becomes due. In this case, FindMyHome.at is entitled to deactivate or delete the customer without this having any effect on the advertiser's liabilities. The advertisements will only be placed online again once the outstanding fee has been paid in full. The advertiser bears the costs of reactivation in the amount of EUR 59.00 net.</p>

            </p>
            <p>4.11. FindMyHome.at makes the presentation space for properties available to the advertising customer by means of direct input or automatic data transmission via an interface. However, it is the sole responsibility of the customer to enter, activate, change and delete real estate advertisements.
