            <p>On the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the user is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law <span>(https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).</span></p>

Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data. We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization.

Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

The personal data of the users will be deleted or made anonymous after 14 months.</p>
            <h6>10. Google – Re/Marketing Services</h6>
            <p>We use the marketing and remarketing services ("Google Marketing Services" for short) on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO). ") of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ("Google"). Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law ( <a class="a_color text-decoration-underline" href="#">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a>). The Google marketing services allow us to display advertisements for and on our website in a more targeted manner in order to only present users with advertisements that potentially match their interests. If, for example, a user is shown ads for products that he was interested in on other websites, this is referred to as "remarketing". For these purposes, when our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active are accessed, Google executes a code directly and so-called (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as "web referred to as "beacons") integrated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie is placed on the user's device, ie a small file is saved (comparable technologies can also be used instead of cookies). The cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file notes which websites the user visits, what content he is interested in and which offers he clicked on, as well as technical information on the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting times and other information on the use of the online offer. The IP address of the user is also recorded, whereby we inform you within the framework of Google Analytics, that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases is transmitted in full to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address is not merged with the user's data within other Google offers. The above information can also be combined by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, the ads tailored to his interests can be displayed to him. User data is processed pseudonymously as part of Google Marketing Services. This means that Google does not store and process, for example, the name or e-mail address of the user, but processes the relevant data in relation to cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that from Google's point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie owner, regardless of who this cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has expressly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected by Google Marketing Services about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the USA. The Google marketing services we use include the online advertising program "Google AdWords". In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different "conversion cookie". This means that cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained with the help of the cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers find out the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified. We can integrate third-party advertisements on the basis of the Google marketing service "AdSense". AdSense uses cookies to enable Google and its partner websites to serve ads based on users' visits to this website and other websites on the Internet. We can also use the "Google Tag Manager" to integrate and manage the Google analysis and marketing services on our website. For more information on how Google uses data for marketing purposes, see the overview page:<a class="a_color text-decoration-underline" href="#">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads</a> , Google's privacy policy is available at<a class="a_color text-decoration-underline" href="#"> https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a> .

            <h6>12. Integration of Third-Party Services and Content</h6>
            <p>Within our platform, services and online offer, we use content or service offers from third-party providers on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO), to integrate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content"). This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content. We endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.
